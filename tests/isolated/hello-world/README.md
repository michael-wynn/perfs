## hello-world (in isolation)
A web server's main job is to orchestrate relevant middleware, to find and execute target codes, and to handle exceptions in response to any particular request.  In an app that has only one service point there is nothing to orchestrate or to search through, thus measuring it tells nothing about the server's performance.

This test is therefore practically meaningless.  It is included anyway for the sake of satisfying curiosities only.
